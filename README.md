This is the first website I made in PLP, my portfolio😁😁. I intend to build upon it as time goes by (especially the projects part). For now it has some projects but due to the fact that I had not yet understood deployment of the projects that list is not updated. To see the website live, I used vercel and here is the link🎯: https://plp-portfolio-eta.vercel.app/
